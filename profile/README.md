## About this organization

This organization holds several challenges repository.

In each repository, a README.md file giving instructions about what is expected.
Except when otherwise noted, you may write your code in any language as long as the instructions are fulfilled.
Some repositories may have several branches with starting points in different languages.

You need to send a pull request to the branch from where you started if you want to be reviewed.

I review on my free time, so please consider donating via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/jeremyVignelles?frequency=one-time).
I always take the time to be helpful in my review comments, so don't be afraid to post your code, you will likely learn new things.

If you fix every comments I made, I will mark the pull request as "Accepted" : that's your "success certificate" :smile:

## Rules

- You may use google/stackoverflow/youtube/whatever website to know how to do things
- You may ask questions by raising issues to the challenge repository
- You may use whatever language/tool/IDE you want, unless specified.
- There's no point in cheating. Really do the work and you'll improve your skills. If you want to be a painter, asking others to paint on your behalf is not an efficient way to improve your painting skills.
That's not to say you cannot ask for help from a friend, as long as he teaches you how to do and you understand what you're doing.

## The challenges

The challenges are independent, you can pick whichever you want, but they are sorted by difficulty (in my own point of view).

## Why ?

When you start your career as a junior developer, you often face a lot of job offers requiring `"X years working with <new tech that is only a few month old>"`.

You probably don't have that much experience, but you've probably learnt how to do `stuff` (and hopefully learnt how to use google and/or StackOverflow in the process).

These challenges won't explain "how to do stuff", it's not a tutorial.
You will need to search online for the missing puzzle pieces, just like you would do in a real company.

These challenges are not "algorithmic puzzles" like [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/start),
but are instead focused on real-life situations you will need to face as a developer.

There are several goals:
- Learn new technologies by doing and searching by yourself
- Prove yourself you are able to write code you were not capable of writing before starting the exercice (just like in a real company)
- Get feedback to improve the quality of your code
- Assess that you are actually capable of applying the technology you claim to know in your résumé (and why not, link your PR there !)
